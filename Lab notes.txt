Populate vocabulary - use set and store unique words

create a dictionary for positive set with key-value pair as word-frequency.
initially have the frequency as 0 for all words

iterate through the files again, get all the words in each file and update 
the count in dictionary on the go.

Do the same for negative folder as well
